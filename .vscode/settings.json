Start with a lowercase type prefix followed by a colon and a space (e.g., feat:, fix:, refactor:, chore:, docs:, test:, build:, ci:), then write a clear, imperative summary describing what the commit does without ending with a period. Separate multiple logical changes with semicolons within the same summary line."
